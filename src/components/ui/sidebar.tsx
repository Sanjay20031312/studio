"use client"

// This component is intentionally left non-functional
// as per the design decision to move navigation to header/footer.
// It can be removed if it's confirmed no part of the build process
// or other components (e.g., tailwind.config.js theme referencing sidebar vars)
// indirectly rely on its presence or variables.
// For now, returning null to ensure it doesn't render.

export function Sidebar() {
  return null;
}

// If any other specific exports from the original sidebar.tsx were needed by other parts
// (e.g. context, specific sub-components for a different use case), they would go here.
// Based on current design, it's fully unused.
